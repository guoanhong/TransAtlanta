TransAtlanta - Visualization to Support Sustainable Development

Project Team Members: Anhong Guo, Haozhe Li, Zhengyang Shen, Qian Xie

Advisor: John Stasko

In this project, we work with the Westside Communities Alliance (WCA) to develop an interactive visualization in an effort to support the sustainable Westside development. In particular, we focus on the development and transit perspective, exploring the segregation issues in the city of Atlanta, the economic impact with the improved transit coordination and the economic impact of major institutes have on Atlantaâ€™s Westside communities, such as Georgia Tech.

**Target Users**

The targeted users of the visualization are community stakeholders, researchers, local government agencies, and relevant foundations. In particular, real estate developers and local non-profit organizations are our primary users. Real estate developers, who are looking to buy a land or develop residential, commercial or retail structures, will be using our system to facilitate their investment decisions, to make a case in the neighborhood planning meeting, and to apply for funding from the city planning group. Local non-profit organizations such as United Way and the Blank Foundation will use our system to help them to apply for grants on projects that are beneficial to the neighborhood development. Other users include churches that offer shuttle services to the seniors and children, and public service officials, such as police and social workers.

**Data**

The data for our visualization will come from the following five sources: Neighborhood Nexus data, Marta transportation and ridership data, Georgia Tech employee data, Walk Score data, and Google Map.
